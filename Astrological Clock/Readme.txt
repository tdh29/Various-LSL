Thic clock tells you time and also the current zodiac/ star sign. The hands of the clock are defined by the names of the links "Hour Hand", "Minute Hand", "Astro Hand". 

This is setup for hands that have been made in mesh so that the centre of the mesh/link is the pivot point.

The clock displays GMT (BST). On click the user can adjust the time to match their timezone in a + or - hour.
